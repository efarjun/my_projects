# Backup etcd:

# To get the required information:

kubectl -n kube-system describe po etcd-controlplane

# Replaceca, cert, and key files with file names from previous command, then choose a backup file location:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=<trusted-ca-file> --cert=<cert-file> --key=<key-file> \
  snapshot save <backup-file-location>

# Restore etcd:

# Replace data dir location with name of file location you want to use and snapshotdb with backup location from previous command:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --data-dir <data-dir-location> snapshot restore <snapshotdb>

# edit the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml file to add the new backup file location for "etcd-data".
